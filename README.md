# McLTT: A Bottom-up Approach to Implementing A Proof Assistant

In McLTT, we build a verified, runnable typechecker. After the accomplishment of this
project, we will obtain an executable, to which we can feed a program in Martin-Loef
type theory and this executable will check whether this program has the specified
type. McLTT is novel in that it is implemented in Coq. Moreover, we will prove that
the typechecking algorithm extracted from Coq is sound and complete: a program passes
typechecking if and only it is a well-typed program in MLTT. This will be the first
verified proof assistant (despite being elementary). 


## Architecture

McLTT has the following architecture:

```
    | source code of McLTT
    v
+-------+
| lexer |          OCaml code generated by ocamllex
+-------+
    | stream of tokens
    v
+--------+
| parser |         Coq code generated by Menhir
+--------+
    | concrete syntax tree
    v
+------------+
| elaborator |     Coq code
+------------+
    | abstract syntax tree
    v
+-------------+
| typechecker |    Coq code
| (normalizer |
|   included) |
+-------------+
    | yes or no    Driver in OCaml
    v
```

In this architecture, most code is in Coq, with accompanying theorems to justify the
implementation. 


## Dependencies

* OCaml 4.14.0
* Menhir
* Coq 8.16.1
* Equations 1.3

We recommend to install dependencies in the following way:

```bash
opam switch add coq-8.16.1 4.14.0
opam pin add coq 8.16.1
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-equations
```
